To obtain my master's degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, I wrote a thesis titled "Mathematical modeling and simulation of the chemotactic movement of neutrophils in inflammatory environments."\
It consists of the derivation of a mathematical model for neutrophil movement under certain circumstances. For it, I combined two famous mathematical models: the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis and the Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinetics. The resulting model was then simulated using MATLAB and the PDE Toolbox™ by MathWorks.\
A detailed version of the numerical simulation for this thesis is displayed in this repository.
